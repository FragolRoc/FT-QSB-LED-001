Version - 2.0 (June 8, 2021)

Made beefier grounding planes and increased trace width. New design is on EasyEDA/Open Soure Hardware. Gerber files will be updated later.

Version - 1.3 (April 23, 2021)

This is my first PCB design and was created as a CAD practice project. Although not needed, this QSB allows you to drive an LED from the underside of the redesigned NES/Av Famicom/SNES. It solders onto the switch's ground pins and terminal posts. Although only ground and one of the switch posts is used for the board, solderable vias are provided to act as an anchor point. The only component that needs to be added to the board is R1 which is a resistor of your choice. Testing shows that a minimum of 370-ohms is required for R1, but you can use anything you have on-hand as long as it's greater than 370-ohms. For reference I use a 1k ohm SMT resistor. Positive and negative pads are labeled for the LED.

A list of materials used are as follows:
- FT-QSB-LED-001 board
- 28 AWG wire/conduct
- 3mm LED of your choosing
- 0603 SMT resistor > 370-ohms
- 3D printed LED housing (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4839916)
- 1/16th inch acrylic rod light pipe (https://www.amazon.com/Plastruct-AR-2H-Clear-Rod-16/dp/B0006O6QXU/)
- 1/16th inch drill bit
- (optional: glue)

CAD files for the LED housing and PCB will available through this repository and updated as needed.

Installation notes/resources will be added as they are created.
